As a user, I want to immediately be able to tell how much time is left in a round, so I know how much longer I have to write or how much longer until
I see the round results

As a user, I want to be able to submit one writing/vote per round, so that I can play a fair game 

As a user, I want to everyone's progress tracked over the span of the story, so that the game can have a winner 

As a user, I want to see the winner/stats of each round, so that I can see how I am doing in comparison to others 

As a user, I want to be able to keep my stats for the story when I exit the app, so that I can play without being connected to the app constantly 

As a user, I want to know how to play the game 

As a user, I want to see a record of the past stories, so I can reminisce 

As a user, I want to be notified when another player submits a writing or vote, so that I can get a sense of community 

As a user, I want to have global leaderboards, so I can strive to win something bigger than a story

As a user, I want to have some stories with a specific theme or unique requirement, so that the game doesn't get stale

As Greg, I want to have some db security, so that I don't get hacked
